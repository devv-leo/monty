# Automated GitHub Contributions

This repository demonstrates automated daily contributions using GitHub Actions.

## How it works

This repository uses GitHub Actions to automatically make daily contributions Monday through Friday at midnight UTC. The workflow:

1. Runs on a scheduled basis using cron syntax
2. Creates a timestamp entry in `contributions.log`
3. Commits and pushes the changes to maintain an active contribution streak

## Files

- `.github/workflows/daily-contribution.yml` - The GitHub Actions workflow
- `contributions.log` - Log of all automated contributions
- `README.md` - This file (updated by the workflow)

## Manual Trigger

You can manually trigger the workflow by:
1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository
2. Selecting "Daily Contributions" workflow
3. Clicking "Run workflow"

## Schedule

The workflow runs automatically:
- **Days**: Monday through Friday
- **Time**: Midnight UTC (00:00)
- **Timezone**: UTC

## Contribution Log

Check the `contributions.log` file to see all automated contributions made by this workflow.
